## 🧠 What is Linux?

Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on Unix. It powers servers, desktops, mobile devices, embedded systems, and more. Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux gives you full control and customization of your system.

## 🕰️ Brief History

- **1991**: Linus Torvalds created the Linux kernel.
- Community and companies like Red Hat, Canonical (Ubuntu), and SUSE contributed to development.
- Grew rapidly as an alternative to UNIX and Windows systems.

## 🧩 Linux Kernel vs. Linux Distribution

- **Kernel**: Core part of the operating system (created by Linus Torvalds)
- **Distribution (Distro)**: Kernel + software + package management tools

## 🖥️ Installing Linux

### Options:
1. **Virtual Machine** (Recommended for beginners)
   - Use VirtualBox or VMware
   - Install ISO images (e.g., Ubuntu Server)

2. **Live USB**
   - Boot directly from USB to try Linux without installing

3. **Dual Boot**
   - Install alongside Windows (advanced)

4. **Cloud Platforms**
   - Launch Linux on AWS EC2, Google Cloud VM, Azure

---

## 🧪 Practice Task

- Download and install **Ubuntu Server** or **Debian** on VirtualBox
- Explore the interface: login, try `ls`, `pwd`, and `shutdown`
